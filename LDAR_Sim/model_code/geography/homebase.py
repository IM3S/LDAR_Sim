def find_homebase(lon, lat, homebase_locs):
    '''
    Find the nearest home base from home bases list
    Parameters
    ----------
    lon, and lat contains longitude and latitude of the current crew location
    homebase_locs : A list that includes latitudes and longitudes of all home bases

    Returns
    -------
    The latitude and longitude of nearest home base and the distance to that home base in km.

    '''
    Find the home base that nearest to both LDAR team and next visit facility.
    Parameters
    ----------
    lon1 and lat1 are longitude and latitude of the current location of LDAR crew
